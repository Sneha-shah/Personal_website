Current model generates a rough graph which is accurate only for notes held longer. Working on accuracy of the identification by using different window types and sizes.
Long term aim is to create a mobile application that helps beginner singers identify the accuracy of the note they are currently singing.</description></item><item><title>Sudoku Solver</title><link>https://example.com/portfolio/sudoku-solver/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2021 19:47:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/portfolio/sudoku-solver/</guid><description>GUI sudoku solver that combines manual and backtracking approaches for quicker solving.

Aural tuning is time consuming and requires the help of a professional. This motivates the question of whether this process can be automated. Attempts at automatic tuning are usually assessed by comparing the Railsback curve of the results with the curve of a professional tuner. In this paper we determine a simple and reliable rule for tuning the high tones of a piano with the help of a listening test.</description></item><item><title>Getting started</title><link>https://example.com/post/getting-started/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2019 09:37:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/post/getting-started/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here are some details to help you getting started with this theme.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Portfolio Definition</title><link>https://example.com/post/portfolio-definition/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2019 19:49:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/post/portfolio-definition/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here are some details about the portfolio settings.&lt;/p>
