Aural tuning is time consuming and requires the help of a professional. This motivates the question of whether this process can be automated. Attempts at automatic tuning are usually assessed by comparing the Railsback curve of the results with the curve of a professional tuner.\nIn this project we determined a simple and reliable rule for tuning the high tones of a piano with the help of a listening test. This rule consists of matching the two tones in an octave interval so that the first partial frequency of the upper tone becomes exactly the same as the second partial frequency of the lower tone. This rule was rated best among four tuning rules that were compared in the test.\nThe results found are explained using a beat-based analysis, and are consistent with some previous studies. They are also tested against the existing method of using Railsback curves, and it is shown that comparison using Railsback curves is an unreliable method of assessing different tunings. The findings from this paper can be used to create a complete automatic tuner that could make the process of piano tuning quick and inexpensive.\nFor a detailed description of the work done, check out my Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s thesis.\nYou can find the paper published on this work here.\n","permalink":"https://sneha-shah.github.io/portfolio/tuning-project/","tags":["Music","MATLAB","Signal Processing","DSP","Thesis"],"title":"Automatic Piano Tuning"},{"categories":["MATLAB"],"contents":"Automatic Classification of Bird Calls Jan 2019 – May 2019 Project under Dr. Sarang C Dhongdi ■ Studied algorithms that use signal processing techniques to identify bird species from their calls or songs, and compared results with machine learning algorithms for the same. ■ This is a continuation of a project where classification was done using mel­frequency cepstral coefficients.\nVoice Scrambler and Unscrambler Aug 2018 – Dec 2018 As Part of ’Digital Signal Processing’ Course ■ Designing a system that scrambles and unscrambles voice signal for safe, loss­less transmission. The process primarily involves modulation with a key frequency, and includes 2 low pass filters. ■ The model was first tested on MATLAB and finally implemented on TI 6748 DSP kit. It was tested on recorded as well as real­time audio data. ■ Correlation between original and scrambles signal was found to be 0.05, while correlation between original and unscrambled signal was found to be 0.98.\nGive URL as project reports\n","permalink":"https://sneha-shah.github.io/portfolio/college-projects/","tags":["MATLAB","DSP","Signal Processing"],"title":"College Projects"},{"categories":["Python"],"contents":"Game created in high school for 12th grade Computer Science project.
