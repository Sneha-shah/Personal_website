Hey! My name is Sneha and my main interest is in the field of audio signal processing. I am a trained western classical pianist and amateur singer. I did my Bachelor’s in Electronics and Instrumentation at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS, Goa). I was a part of my [University band](https://youtu.be/9fcPc-Uc2k4) and also co-founded the acapella group, [Synchronoise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXnmOIKVCyc). I did my Bachelor’s thesis on Automatic Piano Tuning at Aalto University, Finland, where I first combined my interests in music and technology.

I currently spend my time teaching the piano and working on personal projects. I am interested in the application of technology to help aid learning and composition for amateur musicians. You can check out some of my work in the project section at the top right of this page, or have a look at my GitHub. Feel free to mail or message me if you want to collaborate or talk about any of my work :)

Outside of work, I am an active sportsperson. I was part of my University Football team and participated in various other sports at the school level. Lately, my interests have been drawn to rock climbing, and after the olympics I'm very keen on improving my abilities in this area. I regularly go for treks and hope to try outdoor bouldering as well soon.
