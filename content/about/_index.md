Hey! I'm Sneha, a student at Stanford pursuing my Master's in MA Music, Science and Technology. My main focus is in the field of audio signal processing and machine learning. Currently, I am researching how to predict piano notes for Network Piano Performance. I am also working on building a perceptual audio codec and automatically tuning a piano. You can check out some of my work in the project section at the top right of this page, or have a look at my GitHub. 


I am a trained western classical pianist and amateur singer. I did my Bachelor’s in Electronics and Instrumentation at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS, Goa). I was a part of my [University band](https://youtu.be/9fcPc-Uc2k4) and also co-founded the acapella group, [Synchronoise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXnmOIKVCyc). I did my Bachelor’s thesis on Automatic Piano Tuning at Aalto University, Finland, where I first combined my interests in music and technology. I also taught the piano and have worked on several projects in the field. 


Outside of work, I am an active sportsperson. I was part of my University Football team and participated in various other sports at the school level. Lately, my interests have been drawn to rock climbing, and after the olympics I'm very keen on improving my abilities in this area. I regularly go for treks and hope to try outdoor bouldering as well soon.


Feel free to mail or message me if you want to collaborate or talk about any of my work :)
