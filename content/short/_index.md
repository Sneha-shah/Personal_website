Hey! I'm Sneha, a student at Stanford pursuing my Master's in MA Music, Science and Technology. My main focus is in the field of audio signal processing and machine learning. Currently, I am researching how to predict piano notes for Network Piano Performance. I am also working on building a perceptual audio codec and automatically tuning a piano.  I did my Bachelor’s in Electronics and Instrumentation at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS, Goa), where I was a part of the [University band](https://sneha-shah.github.io/portfolio/performances-musoc/) and also co-founded the acapella group, [Synchronoise](https://sneha-shah.github.io/portfolio/performances-synchro/). I did my Bachelor’s thesis on [Automatic Piano Tuning](https://sneha-shah.github.io/portfolio/tuning-project/) at Aalto University, Finland, where I first combined my interests in music and technology.

My latest projects can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sneha-shah) and my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y7ZEeYqI8DVXFgLuGBUzphfAP0wibP_V/view?usp=sharing). You can also browse my website to see some of my projects. You can see my projects in the categories [performances](https://sneha-shah.github.io/categories/performance/), [signal processing](https://sneha-shah.github.io/categories/signal-processing/) (music and audio projects) and [software programming](https://sneha-shah.github.io/categories/software-programming/).
