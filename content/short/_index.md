Hey! My name is Sneha and my main interests are in the field of audio signal processing. I am a trained western classical pianist and amateur singer. I did my Bachelor’s in Electronics and Instrumentation at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS, Goa). I was a part of my [University band](https://sneha-shah.github.io/portfolio/performances-musoc/) and also co-founded the acapella group, [Synchronoise](https://sneha-shah.github.io/portfolio/performances-synchro/). I did my Bachelor’s thesis on [Automatic Piano Tuning](https://sneha-shah.github.io/portfolio/tuning-project/) at Aalto University, Finland, where I first combined my interests in music and technology.

You can browse my website to see some of my projects. You can see my projects in the categories [music](https://sneha-shah.github.io/categories/music/) (performances), [signal processing](https://sneha-shah.github.io/categories/signal-processing/) (music and audio projects) and [python](https://sneha-shah.github.io/categories/python/) (other projects).
