Automatic Classification of Bird Calls Jan 2019 – May 2019 Project under Dr. Sarang C Dhongdi
■ Studied algorithms that use signal processing techniques to identify bird species from their calls or songs, and compared results with machine learning algorithms for the same.
■ This is a continuation of a project where classification was done using mel­frequency cepstral coefficients.

Voice Scrambler and Unscrambler Aug 2018 – Dec 2018 As Part of ’Digital Signal Processing’ Course
■ Designing a system that scrambles and unscrambles voice signal for safe, loss­less transmission. The process primarily involves modulation with a key frequency, and includes 2 low pass filters.
■ The model was first tested on MATLAB and finally implemented on TI 6748 DSP kit. It was tested on recorded as well as real­time audio data.
■ Correlation between original and scrambles signal was found to be 0.05, while correlation between original and unscrambled signal was found to be 0.98.
